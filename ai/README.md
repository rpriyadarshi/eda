# Introduction 
Electronic Design Automation industry builds very complex software systems to address the needs of the complexities of semiconductor manufacturing. Every chip maker generally organically grows the design flows that are used to build their products. Along with these flows are enormous amounts of automation put in place over the years. With the advent of Generative AI, it is envisioned that a lot of the flow building can itself be automated. 

This project is an effort towards automated flow generation using Generative AI using freely available tools like Intel's Quartus Prime, Vivado etc. Initially, FPGA EDA tools are a target to build a PoC. The learnings will be applied towards EDA tool flows for the ASIC industry. There is also a parallel effort to manage fine-grained flows deeply integrated within the EDA tools. What is not under consideration at the moment is actually tackle the algorithmic solvers as they are generally highly specialized and evolved for the problems being solved. 

# Getting Started
The system is currently built around Quartus Prime Lite that is available at Intel's website at no charge. The source tree is shown next along with some explaination.
* PyQt's resource compiler can be run as shown below: 
  * ```pyside6-rcc -o qrc_resources.py resources.qrc``` 

Ai Artist is a chatbot that uses OpenAI in the background. It uses function calling in OpenAI, simplified through LangChain. 
* You can run the chatbot's Holoviz GUI (WIP) as follows:
  * ```panel serve pn_gui.py --autoreload```
* You can also run PyQt based GUI (WIP) as follows:
  * ```python qt_gui.py```
